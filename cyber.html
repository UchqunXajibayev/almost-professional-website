  <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-8">Cybersecurity Projects</h1>

  <p class="text-gray-300 leading-7 mb-6">
    Cybersecurity became one of my main passions because it forces me to think like an
    engineer, a programmer, and a problem-solver all at once. I practice only on systems
    I own or have permission for — not to break rules, but to understand how real systems
    work and how to secure them.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-300 leading-7 mb-6">
    I explore networking fundamentals such as ports, TCP/UDP communication, routing,
    sockets, DNS queries, and packet behavior. I work with tools like netcat, socat,
    reverse shells, curl headers, local listeners, and Linux terminal networking.
    These tools taught me how devices talk to each other behind the scenes.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-300 leading-7 mb-6">
    Using Kali Linux, I’ve studied service enumeration, scanning, device discovery, shell
    interaction, and permissions. I enjoy understanding what each service does, how networks
    can be secured, and how vulnerabilities happen in the first place.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-300 leading-7 mb-10">
    Cybersecurity changed the way I think. It made me more analytical, patient, and curious.
    Instead of simply using technology, I learned to understand its structure, behavior, and
    weak points. Every system I study makes me want to learn even more.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-green-400">Ethical Network Security Analysis</h2>

  <p class="text-gray-300 leading-7 mb-6">
    As part of my learning process, I conducted a responsible security analysis of my
    school’s network using only my own laptop and completely non-intrusive methods.
    I identified weaknesses such as open ports, outdated routers, and misconfigured
    authentication — the type of issues that create real-world vulnerabilities.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-300 leading-7 mb-6">
    I did not access private data or disrupt any systems. My goal was to understand where
    weaknesses usually appear and how they can be fixed. After documenting my findings, I
    informed school staff so they could improve their network security.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-300 leading-7 mb-12">
    This experience taught me how important ethical responsibility is in cybersecurity.
    Understanding security is not about breaking systems — it’s about protecting them
    before someone else does.
