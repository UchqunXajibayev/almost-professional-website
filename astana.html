  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">
    The Astana competition was my first major international robotics experience and the
    moment I realized how much I wanted engineering to be part of my life. Representing
    Uzbekistan wasn’t just an honor — it forced me to grow fast and take real
    responsibility for my work.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">
    Our team built a Spike Prime robot from scratch. I focused on mechanical design,
    gear balancing, sensor placement, and precision turning. Every day was hands-on:
    testing, adjusting, breaking, rebuilding, rewriting code, and improving movement
    accuracy. Nothing worked perfectly the first time, which taught me how real
    engineering is done.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">
    The competition was intense — timed rounds, quick strategy changes, new challenges
    thrown at us constantly. I had to think clearly under pressure, solve problems
    quickly, and communicate with my team in a calm and focused way.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">
    Astana didn’t just give me experience. It built my confidence. It showed me that I
    enjoy solving tough problems, leading technical decisions, and competing in an
    environment where skill actually matters.
