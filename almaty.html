  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">
    Almaty was on a completely different level from Astana. The teams were more
    experienced, the challenges were harder, and every point mattered. This competition
    pushed me far beyond what I thought my limits were.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">
    I upgraded our robot dramatically — optimized turning accuracy, improved attachment
    stability, rewrote movement sequences, and experimented with proportional control.
    I spent hours testing every angle, making sure our movements were consistent down to
    the smallest detail.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">
    Our team ended up placing second among strong international competitors. It wasn’t
    luck — it was hours of debugging, rebuilding, testing, and learning from failures.
    The moment we received the certificate that qualified us toward the Australia finals
    felt unreal. That second-place finish means more to me than any medal I’ve ever won.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">
    Almaty taught me how to compete like an engineer: stay calm, adapt instantly, and
    think logically even when things go wrong. It made me want to push my skills even
    further.
