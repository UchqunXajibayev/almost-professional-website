Part 3:  

I am interested in engineering and robotics and I'm also interested in technology, there is a movie called star wars. It's very interesting and has amazing robots in the movie. I intent to create robots in the future. My purpose in going to Turkey is to find out how the rockets work and what are inside them I want to learn them. And I want to put artificial intelligence in robots because it learns what it sees and I really want those robots to benefit people. I have already started working on these.

Part 4: 

Robots are our friends. Let me explain why. They are very helpful in routine works and can be useful for humans. We have problems in this world, for example, energy. We waste gas and fuel, we don't have the right solar panels. Robots, with humans, can solve these problems.

When I was 8 years old, I went to the Yangiobod Bazar. They sell a lot of electronics there. My dad said, "Are you interested in making a robot". I said, "Yes". Then for the first time I got a motor and a battery and put them together and it was amazing. I started making many things. For example, a mini washing machine, and a tattoo machine, a plane with remote control, and a boat. 

For me it’s interesting how doors of supermarket opens automatically when someone came to near the door. Also how escalator starts move only someone come to close. I think it’s a good solution for ecology also to spare electric energy. I want to implement these kind of solutions in different robots to make them more useful.

They don't get tired often people create robots like themselves. Robots are usually machines controlled by computer programs or electronic circuits. If you put artificial intelligence into robots they will be smart. Let me tell you what artificial intelligence is. Artificial intelligence (AI) is special software which helps robot to learn some habits like human. It makes robot smarter. 

Robots can do many things. In future I will create robots with AI to solve many problems.
