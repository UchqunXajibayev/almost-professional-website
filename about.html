  <div class="bg-[#1a1a1a] p-8 rounded-2xl shadow-xl border border-gray-700">

    <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">
      I’m a student who grew up obsessed with taking things apart — electronics,
      devices, tools, anything mechanical. I learn by doing, breaking, fixing,
      and rebuilding.  
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">
      My main interests focus on engineering, robotics, system security, and
      hands-on technical problem-solving. I don’t like learning things only from
      books — I prefer building and experimenting until I actually understand
      how something works.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">
      Outside competitions and school, I spend most of my time improving my
      technical skills: working with Linux, exploring cybersecurity, testing
      network behavior, and building projects that challenge me to think deeper.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">
      I’m focused on growth, discipline, and becoming someone who can contribute
      to real engineering work — not just pass exams. I like solving problems
      where there’s no clear answer and learning tools that real engineers use
      every day.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">
      My long-term goal is to study engineering at MIT — not for the name,
      but because I want to build, discover, and push myself beyond the limits
      of a normal school environment.
